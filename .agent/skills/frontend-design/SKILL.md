# About
This skill guides you in creating high-end, functional, and visually striking frontend interfaces. It is designed to avoid generic "AI-generated" aesthetics by focusing on intentionality, brand-alignment, and meticulous refinement.

# Principles

## 1. Typography
- **Distinctive Pairs**: Always choose a bold, personality-driven display font (e.g., Tan, Outfit, Calistoga) paired with a refined, highly legible body font (e.g., Suisse, Inter, IBM Plex Sans).
- **Avoid Defaults**: Never use Arial, Roboto, or generic sans-serif stacks.
- **Intentional Scaling**: Use a clear typographic scale. Headers should be impactful and intentional.

## 2. Spatial Composition
- **Break the Grid**: Use staggered columns, overlapping elements, and asymmetrical layouts to create visual interest.
- **Generous Whitespace**: Use whitespace to guide the user's eye and create a sense of "lightness" and "airiness".
- **Dynamic Flow**: Arrange content to create an invisible roadmap through the page.

## 3. Color & Texture
- **Dominant Aesthetics**: Commit to a cohesive color palette early. Use CSS variables for all tokens.
- **Sharp Accents**: Use high-contrast accents to draw attention to interactive elements.
- **Atmosphere**: Add depth with gradient meshes, subtle noise textures, and layered transparencies.

## 4. Motion & Interactivity
- **Purposeful Animation**: Use animations to explain relationships, not just for "flash".
- **Staggered Reveals**: Implement entering animations that reveal content in a logical sequence.
- **Micro-interactions**: High-energy hover states, smooth transitions, and tactile feedback.

## 5. Production Excellence
- **Clean Code**: Use semantic HTML and modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid, CSS Modules).
- **Responsiveness**: Designs MUST be fully functional and aesthetically pleasing on all devices.
- **Refinement**: Review every component for "genericness" and inject personality where possible.
